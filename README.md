## Objective
Built a binary classifier using logistic regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Split data into train/test sets and standardized features
3. Trained a logistic regression model
4. Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
5. Visualized the ROC curve and sigmoid function
6. Experimented with threshold tuning

## Results
